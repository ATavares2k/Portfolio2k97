# Portfolio2k97
 My ups and downs, my errors and trialsâ€”this is my portfolio. Here, I've cried and created something that I can truly call my own. How many people can say they've done that? No one, not even me. The wheel is already invented; everything that comes from it, even with its differences, is a copy of that. Hope you like it.
